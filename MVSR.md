# Securing Critical Projects Working Group MVSR

## Mission

Organizations large and small make use of OSS every day, but many projects are
struggling for the time, resources and attention they need. We need ways to
connect critical projects we all rely on with organizations that can provide
them with support.

## Vision

An entity (public agency, corporation, foundation) with resources to commit to
securing OSS is able to apply those resources to most efficiently improve the
security of critical projects of their selection.

## Strategy

A set of critical projects exists and contains sufficient information to
connect supporters with projects that are critical and need the support.

Build a resource containing the set of critical projects, and information about
those projects:

* Part of the stack, field, tech used, and other details
* Types and kinds of help the project is looking for
* Size and funding of project

The resource will allow contributors to filter, sort, or discover projects by
questionnaire. Then, provide help and direction for how to apply support to
those projects

The working group will host and provide support for projects and tools which
aim to improve the security of critical projects.
