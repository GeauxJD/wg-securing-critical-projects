ㄴProcess for Identifying and Curating a Set of Critical Open Source Projects


SIG: Identifying Critical Projects

Lead(s): Amir Montazery, Jacques Chester, Julia Ferraioli
ㅅMembers:  Securing Critical Projects working group

Objective: An process for nominating, identifying, and prioritizing critical open-source projects. 

Reasoning for Set: Provide a best-effort analysis of quantitative and qualitative research in the open-source ecosystem and generate a curated, living set of projects deemed “critical” to organizations & individuals. We say “set”, not “list”, because we’re not currently trying to order the entries inside the set.

Deliverables:
Phase 1: Set of 100 Critical Projects (i.e “100 Greatest Hits”)
Target Due Date: August 15, 2022
Phase 2: Set of 100 Prioritized Critical Projects
Target Due Date: August 25, 2022
Categorize
Initial Insight from Project
Phase 3: Curation and updating of sets 
Target Due Date: On-going
Phase 4: Breakdown of Critical Projects
Target Due Date: October 27, 2022
Conceptual examples:
“100 Greatest Rock Hits”
“100 Greatest Pop Hits” 
“100 Greatest Dance Hits”

Summary: Critical open-source projects are open source frameworks, components, and applications that support modern technology infrastructure and in which a subversion or disruption to said frameworks, components, and applications would have significant cost and cause significant impact on people and organizations. 

Method: Consensus-based Democracy		 	 	 
				
The group works by consensus most of the time.
This will help decision making be more efficient and seamless. “So long as no one strongly objects”. 
Of course disagreement is OK and discussion is encouraged. 
Workgroup leads can act as “benevolent dictators” when/if needed.
There is a formal voting mechanism to fall back on when consensus cannot be reached. 
For each proposed component, first capture “why it is / isn’t critical” from people & research results, so voting will be informed
Polling mechanism in Zoom? GitHub? Yes/No? Proposal: Use a ranked voting system. There are several systems that implement various ranked systems, pick some reasonable one.
What is the most simple, reasonable working voting mechanism we can employ when needed? 

Process for Identifying and Prioritizing Projects

A - Ingestion Engine
The community can suggest/nominate a project.
Google Form - Standardized and agreed upon template
Selection Criteria/supporting evidence for nomination
Proposer must include rationale “why is this critical”
Feeds automatically into “Identified Projects” as a Google Sheet 

Ingestion Engine Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AyBRzDXeFSJlHV-jtUPT1YIAq8rC9n34im_AUfIWfps

B - Identified Projects
Set of Nominated Projects
Projects nominated based on expertise
“Edge Cases” 
Emerging Projects
Projects from research
Harvard Census Study
Pull count data
etc.

Next Step: Create MVP for ingestion engine

INGESTION ENGINE & IDENTIFIED PROJECTS

Google form with standardized template?
Selection criteria
Can choose multiple 
Feed into set of identified projects


Action: Projects graduate from “Identified” to “Prioritized” after discussion with the workgroup. At this stage it is recommended to get first-hand insight from the project maintainer(s). Time will be allocated in each workgroup meeting to discuss projects on the Identified Projects set and review the set of prioritized projects. 

Action: Expert Solicitation, Review, and Validation

C - Prioritized Projects
Categorization
Suggestion: Categorize per Julia’s recommendation

Data Sources

We should brainstorm these and list them - how do we find “edge cases” and projects that fly under the radar
